# 2026-04-24 (distil-97): once the subnet enters steady-state (all ~65
# valid models in ``state.scores``), ``select_challengers`` yields zero
# P1/P3 candidates because every UID is considered "already evaluated".
# ``add_top5_contenders`` then fills with the 4 H2H leaderboard slots
# and the round settles at 5-6 models — fine for tracking the king vs
# top-4 but blind to any dormant miner whose global KL (measured vs an
# earlier king on a different prompt set) is actually better than the
# current king's H2H KL. Without re-rotation, the subnet ranking
# silently goes stale and dormant miners with legitimately better
# models cannot regain the crown without re-uploading.
#
# ``DORMANT_ROTATION_N`` adds that many dormant miners per round,
# filtered to those whose ``state.scores[uid]`` beats the current
# king's h2h_kl (so we only spend compute on candidates who could
# plausibly win). Default 2 = ~16 extra minutes per round with
# shadow axes off, fits inside the 60-75min target.

# into the top-4 leaderboard, then privates the repo (restricted/gated on HF).
# Validator can never re-verify it, the entry sits there as a ghost blocking
# a real slot and spamming the TOP-CONTENDER REGRESSION CHECK warning every
# round. UID 64 (sampleratez/3406940) has been stuck like this for 4+ rounds.
# After this many consecutive precheck failures we drop the entry from the
# persisted leaderboard. The counter resets the moment precheck passes again,
# so transient HF blips (see 60317bb) don't evict anyone unfairly.
